A simple website made from following a Microsoft tutorial<br />
Shows interactivity by using Javascript to click a button on the page switching between light and dark mode<br />
Implements logging in the console of the website every time the button is pressed<br />
Uses an event listener to listen for the click event on the website<br />
Using an If statement upon the click event it determines what state the website is and changes the color.__
